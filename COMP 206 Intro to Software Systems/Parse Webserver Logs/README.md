In this assignment, we were asked to write a script, webmetrics.sh,  to parse webserver logs and
produce three metrics:
1. Number of requests coming from the browsers Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.
2. Number of distinct users (distinct IP addresses) per day.
3. Top 20 popular requests by product ID.

Then, we wrote a script, runlogs.sh, to run webmetrics.sh on some provided weblogs.
