In this assignment, we were asked to create a simple version of Conway’s
Game Of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway\%27s_Game_of_Life)

0's represented dead cells and 1's represented live cells.

The rules were as follows:
• Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.
• Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
• Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if caused by overpopulation.
• Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if caused by reproduction.
